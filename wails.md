# Wails v1

## Building a Server with Wails

Anything in your `main()` function will run when you run `wails serve`.
You can also run the backend normally with `go run .` but you will get some errors in your terminal from Wails which you don't have to worry about.
It just means wails won't run properly with that command which is fine if you're just testing your backend functionality without Wails.

## Debugging Backend

note: it is way easier to debug your application, especially when debugging why it's not successfully writing to DB by commenting out the Wails stuff and running the backend commands with some sample data.
